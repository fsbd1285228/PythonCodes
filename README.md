# PythonCodes

A place to store the codes when learning Python.

The folder PythonStarter contians most of the codes based on the self-study Python course from Durham University. They have examples and personal solutions to the exercises on the course manual inside.

The folder NeuralNetwork contains the codes of a course on machine learning. The course could be found on shiyanlou.com. More codes on neural network may be added in the future.

This repository is the place where I plan to establish this as a compilation of all my Python codes. Most recent plan is to rewrite the codes which I learned when studying mathematical modeling into Python.
