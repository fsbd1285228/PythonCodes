# PythonStarter

A place to store the codes when learning Python. Most of the codes are based on the self-study Python course from Durham University. Codes now include examples and personal solutions to the exercises on the course manual.

Further plan for this repository include establish this as a compilation of all my Python codes. Most recent plan is to rewrite the codes which I learned when studying mathematical modeling into Python.
